Summary:
I broke down the website into sections. Left, Right, and Bottom.
I created my website using Flexbox. No other libraries or plugins were used.
Through this assignment, I unlearned some of my habits from previous assignments.
I used MARGIN excessively, which created a custom position. This made it
confusing to keep track of what is affecting which element.

Initially, Bootstrap was going to be used so I could make the hamburger menu.
I decided it's not worth the extra click, so I left it at the side. It has a
custom position, because it's convenient when it's always in sight.

I omitted the ABOUT intro, because it didn't have a strong purpose. Therefore,
there is only one ABOUT page.


Challenge #1:
I had difficulty using the picture element to show the image. The layout was also
difficult, because when resized, it would be in an irregular pattern.
Ex., It would be a 4x2 grid instead of a 3x3. There also would be
duplicates.

Solution #1:
The picture element somewhat works. The image doesn't resize, but when I added
another source, and deleted the media query for the smaller screen, there
were no longer duplicated.

Some text was deleted to get rid of the irregular grid.

Challenge #2:
I had trouble making the layout. It wouldn't go in the spots I wanted it to.

Solution #2:
I had to built the website horizontally. However, I couldn't figure out
how to make the right side of the ABOUT page vertical. When I did,
the icons disappeared.

Challenge #3: Relating to previous assignments, I had major organization
issues becauses the selectors in CSS were scattered, and a lot of things
were scattered.

Soluion #4: Although it's still messy, I broke down and focussed each segment.
This made writing it easier.
